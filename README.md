# personal-project

###
this is my first front-end personal project.
we had to use, API, local Storage, media queries, SASS and bootstrap (what else did I miss?).
I wanted to work with an events API, and ended up choosing this music events API that I could figure out how to use.
#####

this is NO LONGER a music events API project-
this is officially a GOOGLE MAP API project.

apparently there is a black hole here..

while everyone are building rockets ships around me- I am building tiny google maps markers.
I wanted to create an app that shows you every event happening today.
But couldn't find an API that I know how to use with all this information in it.
So I took this music events API.
It was a very rough beginning- not being able to make what I wanted (someone said- attachment?1) was frustrating and I thought
"ho... making an event list of today with a map is not a big deal."
apparently there is a black hole somewhere in Google headquarters.
Someone thought that a documentation in which when you scroll down the side bar doesn't move because it is so long- is funny.
and so- my music events project became a google map project.
starting with API to show the map.
setting markers for each venue.
finding my geolocation(! so freaking cool !).
and than being overwhelmed by the direction documentation- "is this english?! because this is a verb and this is a noun and
I think this is supposed to be a sentence but I can't understand it."
with the support of Dize, Akyuna, Emily, Matt, Fabio and Luke I made it.
This for me was a process of relearning everything that I learned in the last month.
You think you understand scope?! not until you handled this delicate google.mapInit function.
You think You don't understand what is an API? than use 3 of them in one project.
You know what localStorage actually is? Ask Akyuna to explain it in the detailed way, and than add local storage to everything
on your site, only to discover that it will break your delicate google.mapInit function. But at least you know how it works.

To everyone who was there and supported me- thank you for dealing with me.

FYI- my map shows only biking direction- welcome to the revolution.
