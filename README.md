# personal-project

###
this is my first front-end personal project.
we had to use, API, local Storage, media queries, SASS and bootstrap (what else did I miss?).
I wanted to work with an events API, and ended up choosing this music events API that I could figure out how to use.
#####

this is NO LONGER a music events API project-
this is officially a GOOGLE MAP API project.

apparently there is a black hole here..
